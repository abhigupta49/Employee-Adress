>## Data flow
In this project, we have 4 layers-
* **Controller** - The controller layer takes charge of processing HTTP requests, converting JSON parameters into objects, and verifying the request's authenticity before forwarding it to the business (service) layer.
* **Service** -In charge of all business logic, the business layer encompasses service classes and leverages the functionalities offered by data access layers.
* **Repository** - This layer maintains the MySQL-database on which CRUD operations are performed
* **Model** - This layer consists basically the class level things - the various classes required for the project and these classes consists the attributes to be stored.
## Data Structure

* **Employee Address Model**: The Employee Address model represents the data structure for storing employee address information. It typically includes attributes such as employeeId, address, city, state, and postalCode.

## Project Summary

The Employee Address Management system is designed to manage and perform CRUD operations on employee address data. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with employee addresses. The application is built using Spring Boot and uses MySQL as the database for storing employee address information. The API endpoints can be explored and tested using Swagger UI.
